# Magnetic-cleanliness

You can easily use this code for your magnetic cleanliness project. 
Magnetic cleanliness code using dipole. So, you convert source of magnetic to dipole. 
This code is created for my research, "Analysis of CubeSat magnetic cleanliness for the Space science mission".
If you use this code, please cite the source.

Thank you.
